# NamelessMC Installation Script

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT; IT HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETELY TESTED AND MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS.**

## What is the purpose of this script?
There is a easy-install.php for Nameless, but I personally use a VPS to host this software (never in my life have I preferred web hosting). 
All dependencies will be installed, and all you have to do is follow the instructions on the website.

## Tutorial
- Navigate to your domain's provider panel and point an A record to the VPS IP address.
-
- Complete all of the steps and continue with the website setup.

## Supported Operating Systems

Only Unbuntu 20.04.
